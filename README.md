Stupid Bot I wrote in 8 minutes cuz I was bored\
Inspired by https://twitter.com/OnepegMG/status/1548410653370552320

Uses the Speech API in windows along with the tarkov.dev API to provide item prices.

Run program and say "Price \<Item\>" to reccieve the items flea market price.

Will make bot speak with russian accent when i have time
